    <p>I graduated from Purdue University in 2001 with a B.S. in Computer Information Systems.  While
in school I learned Visual Basic 6.0, HTML, JavaScript, SQL, and Oracle.  I worked as an Administrative Specialist
at the Arkansas Department of Environmental Quality from 2006 to 2016.  In my position I maintained Access Databases,
corresponded with companies concerning various fees relating to hazardous waste, and reviewed Hazardous Waste Annual Reports
in the web-based Easitrak System.</p>
